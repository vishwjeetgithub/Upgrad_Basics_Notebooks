It offers several benefits such as:\n","- **Free Access to GPU and TPU**: Colab provides free access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which significantly accelerates the training of machine learning models.\n","- **Cloud-based Environment**: Users can access and work on Colab notebooks directly through a web browser, eliminating the need for local installations. This cloud-based approach facilitates collaboration and allows users to work on projects from different devices.\n","- **Pre-installed Libraries**: Colab comes pre-installed with many commonly used libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, making it convenient for users to start working on machine learning tasks without additional setup.\n","- **Integration with Google Drive**: Colab is seamlessly integrated with Google Drive, enabling users to save and share their Colab notebooks directly in their Google Drive accounts. This integration simplifies version control and sharing of projects.\n","- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can collaborate on the same Colab notebook simultaneously. Changes are reflected in real-time, and users can leave comments for each other within the notebook.\n","- **Version History**: Colab automatically saves version history, allowing users to revert to previous versions of their notebooks. This feature is beneficial for tracking changes and recovering from unintended modifications.\n","- **Support for Markdown**: Colab supports Markdown, enabling users to add formatted text, headers, and multimedia elements to enhance the documentation within their notebooks.\n","\n","The following instructions need to be followed for integrating the Colab notebook with your Google Drive."],"metadata":{"id":"JH97fEpCv3LJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","To read files from Google drive in Colab notebook, we need to \"mount the drive\" using the command below:"],"metadata":{"id":"eYKv9gQONXlP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Once you mount your google drive, you can read data from your google drive into the colab notebook\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"biDHNgQxwUu9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760465100270,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4680,"user":{"displayName":"Vishwjeet Chauhan","userId":"18172836756328719463"}},"outputId":"a0efc9e5-6cee-46f8-f1a6-46292ff3406f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# # second (alternate) way to upload files to colab\n","# # use this to import files from your system to the colab environment\n","\n","# from google.colab import files\n","# uploaded = files.upload()"],"metadata":{"id":"OEZLvy7Eyfdu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Once the Google drive is mounted, you can access the folders and the files in your Google drive.\n","\n","To read files directtly from your Google Drive, you need to create the corresponding folder structure:\n","\n","Go to ```My Drive```, create a folder ```GenAI_Course_Master/Course_1_ShopAssistAI/Week_2/Session_1```\n","\n","The folder structure would be as shown below:\n","```\n","|-MyDrive\n","|--GenAI_Course_Master/\n","|---Course_1_ShopAssistAI/\n","|----Week_2/\n","|-----Session_1/\n","```\n","\n","This is the folder where you will store this notebook and other associated files (such as API keys, data files etc).\n","\n","You can then access all the files in that folder at the following filepath\n","\n","\n","filepath = ```/content/drive/MyDrive/upgrad/GenAI_Course_Master/Course_1_ShopAssistAI/Week_2/Session_1/```"],"metadata":{"id":"F1RjisTEwuYa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Remember to modify the file path based on the path in your Google Drive\n","\n","filepath = '/content/drive/MyDrive/upgrad/GenAI_Course_Master/Course_1_ShopAssistAI/Week_2/Session_1/'"],"metadata":{"id":"PGscQrIUxdw6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760465290633,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Vishwjeet Chauhan","userId":"18172836756328719463"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Linux command to print all files in a directory\n","\n","!ls \"/content/drive/MyDrive/upgrad/GenAI_Course_Master/Course_1_ShopAssistAI/Week_2/Session_1/\""],"metadata":{"id":"6eC_BgxswJTt","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760465292545,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":102,"user":{"displayName":"Vishwjeet Chauhan","userId":"18172836756328719463"}},"outputId":"80d74d31-bcbb-4be7-ea3f-5730fe687916"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["'Copy of Working_With_OpenAI_APIs <> Notebook'\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# import openai and set the API key\n","import openai\n","\n","# with open(filepath + \"OpenAI_API_Key.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n","#   openai.api_key = ' '.join(f.readlines())\n","\n","# Alternatively\n","from google.colab import userdata\n","openai.api_key = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')"],"metadata":{"id":"INJIL5XJzIre","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760468059695,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1781,"user":{"displayName":"Vishwjeet Chauhan","userId":"18172836756328719463"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We can now use any of the OpenAI APIs.
